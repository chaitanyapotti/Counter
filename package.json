An atomic transaction is an indivisible and irreducible series of transactions such that either all occur, or nothing occurs. The contract used is complimentary to BIP-199 so it can be used to transact from ethereum based systems to ethereum based systems or Bitcoin based system(assuming HTLC is allowed).",
